## About

null is a tinkerers framework with ambitions to be the smartest, fastest and simplest way to build WordPress themes.

null provides a platform for both rapid prototyping and production sites and can be used as either a starter theme or parent theme, the choice is yours!

Things you will love:

* HTML5 - Based on the great work of the <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com/">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>.
* Theme Options - Easily create and customise the default theme options thanks to the <a href="https://github.com/devinsays/options-framework-theme">Theme Options Framework</a>.
* Drop In Widgets, Shortcodes and Post Types - Easily bundle extra functionality with your theme. We include a few to get you started.
* WordPress Setup - After activation of the theme you can choose to setup WordPress with a great set default settings, rewrite rules and htaccess trickery.
* LESS - <a href="http://lesscss.org/">A better way to write CSS</a>. All LESS files are automagically parsed and cached, no extra software required.
* Semantic, responsive grid systems - null makes use of <a href="http://semantic.gs/">semantic.gs</a>.

To install this theme:

1. Login to your wp-admin area and visit "Appearance -> Themes". Select the "Install Themes" tab and click on the Upload link at the top of the page. Browse to the null .zip file you have downloaded and hit the "Install Now" button.
1. Alternatively you can unzip the theme folder (.zip). Then, via FTP, upload the "null" folder to your server and place it in the /wp-content/themes/ directory.

### Is there a child starter theme available?

Yes. It is called [null-child](https://github.com/scottsweb/null-child).

### What browsers does null support?

Currently null supports IE6+ and all modern browsers. By the time 1.0 launches support for IE6 and IE7 will most likely be removed.

### Does null pass [Theme-Check](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/theme-check/)?
Not at the moment but it is close. Most of the errors and warnings are fairly minor. The plan is to improve this over time.

### Contributing

Please submit all bugs, questions and suggestions to the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/scottsweb/null/issues) queue.

So this marks an end to the development of null. I am not doing much theme development these days so this feels like a good chance to wrap it up. If I was to put more time towards developing it there are still lots of improvements to be made, some things on my wish list included:

* Provide an example home.php template for an interesting blog landing page
